/**
 *@brief You can apply distance constraints between 2 particles using the QSpring. The physics engine uses QSpring to impose distance constraints between particles in objects already simulated using mass-spring models (e.g. QSoftBody objects). However, if the user wants, they can apply specific distance constraints between any 2 particles using QSpring. QWorld also provides methods to manage QSpring objects.
 *\note You can think of QSpring objects as similar to QJoint, which provides special distance constraints for rigid body objects in particle-based simulations. You can also use QSpring to connect objects with each other, but the constraints are enforced between particles.
 *\warning QSpring will not work correctly on objects that are not simulated with particle dynamics, such as rigid bodies whose positions are fixed by transformations. QSpring relies on the ability to change the positions of particles with freedom of movement to apply constraints correctly.
